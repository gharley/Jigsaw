# Jigsaw
A jigsaw pattern generator

This work is based on the excellent work of Manuel Kasten (Draradech), which is located here: https://gist.github.com/Draradech/35d36347312ca6d0887aa7d55f366e30

I've done a huge amount of refactoring partly to reorganize it but mostly to help me understand the code. Believe me I would not have had a clue about how to approach this starting from scratch on my own. I have added a couple of features but I would not have been able to without Manuel's starting code.

New features:

    Tab offset - the default tab position is half way across the tile (50%), I added a slider to change it between 40% and 60% but the change is applied randomly.

    Randomized jitter - the jitter factor is now applied randomly.
